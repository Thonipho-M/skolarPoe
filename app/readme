Skolar 2.0 is a modern mobile learning-support application designed to improve learner engagement, simplify scheduling with tutors, and provide intelligent chatbot-assisted learning. The app enables students to book tutoring sessions, access academic help, and manage their learning activities seamlessly.

The application was developed by team Open Circle as part of an academic module project where the purpose was to demonstrate real-world software engineering practices such as authentication, offline-first design, cloud integration, and continuous deployment using GitHub Actions.

🎯 Purpose of the App

Skolar 2.0 was created to address several challenges faced by students:

✔ 1. Difficulty accessing academic support

Learners often struggle to get clear answers and schedule help with tutors. Skolar solves this by allowing:

Quick tutor browsing

Instant lesson bookings

Automated notifications

Smart chatbot assistance

✔ 2. Poor communication or delayed feedback

The integrated chatbot provides learning guidance instantly, while notifications keep students informed about updates.

✔ 3. Limited accessibility to learning tools

The app includes:

Biometric authentication

Multiple languages (English & isiZulu)

Offline bookings when internet is not available

Syncing with the backend when the device reconnects

✔ 4. Need for a simplified student support system

Skolar offers:

Easy navigation

Clean UI/UX with Compose

Centralised management of user bookings

🧩 System Design Considerations
🎨 1. UI/UX with Jetpack Compose

The entire app is built using Jetpack Compose to ensure:

Modern declarative UI

Fast rendering

Easy state management

Smooth animations

Theming and dynamic color support

☁️ 2. Cloud Architecture (Firebase)

Skolar uses Firebase for reliable backend services:

Firebase Authentication – email/password login, biometric access

Cloud Firestore – real-time data storage for tutors & bookings

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) – push notifications when chatbot responds

Storage (optional) – for file or profile uploads

📶 3. Offline-First Approach

When the device is offline:

Bookings are stored locally (SQLite / room-like OfflineDbHelper)

The user is notified that the action will sync later

Settings page provides a “Sync Bookings” button

Once online, pending bookings are pushed to Firestore

This ensures zero data loss and continuous usability.

🌐 4. Multi-Language Support

The system uses Android’s resources folder for:

values/strings.xml (English)

values-zu/strings.xml (isiZulu)

All composables load text from stringResource(), allowing dynamic runtime changes.

🔐 5. Security

Firebase Auth token validation

Biometric unlocking (face/fingerprint)

Secure local storage for auth preferences

Re-authentication fallback on biometric failure

🔄 6. Modularity & Clean Architecture

The app uses:

Data layer (FirestoreService, OfflineDbHelper)

Model layer (Booking, Tutor, User)

UI layer (Compose Screens)

Navigation layer (NavHost)

Each component is testable and extendable.

🔧 GitHub & GitHub Actions Usage
🗃 GitHub Repository

GitHub was used for:

Version control

Branching strategy

Managing issues and enhancements

Code review and collaboration

Maintaining the README, documentation, and release notes

Branches:

main – stable production-ready branch

develop – active development

Feature branches – each new feature built independently

⚙️ GitHub Actions (CI/CD Pipeline)

The project uses GitHub Actions for:

✔ Automated Build Pipeline

Whenever code is pushed:

Kotlin/Gradle build is triggered

Lint checks run

Unit tests run

Build artifacts stored

✔ Automated Deployment (Optional)

If integrated, the CI pipeline can publish new APKs to:

GitHub Releases

Firebase App Distribution

Play Store (if configured)

✔ Automated Code Quality Checks

Actions ensure:

No broken builds

No missing dependencies

Code consistency across branches

This ensures a professional development cycle.
